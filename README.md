# Dataset for Automated Three-Dimensional Non-destructive Detection of Rice Chalkiness Driven by VGG-UNet
This dataset supports the reproducibility of results in the paper titled "Automated Three-Dimensional Non-destructive Detection of Rice Chalkiness Driven by VGG-UNet," submitted to the 9th International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing (ICSP 2024).

## Data Collection
The dataset consists of 10 sequential enhanced CT images of unmilled rice grains, obtained using the SkyScan 1172 micro-CT scanner from Bruker Company, with the scanning parameters as specified in Table I of the paper. The images are in 8-bit BMP format.

## Purpose of the Dataset
This dataset is intended to facilitate the replication of the study's findings. Researchers can use this dataset to reproduce the methodology described in the paper. Should additional data be required for further research, please contact the authors.

## Data Enhancement
To ensure the security of our proprietary data, the dataset has undergone data augmentation processes. It is currently not publicly available to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data.
